# Harris-corner-detection
A corner is a point in an image with 2 dominant and different edge directions in a local neighborhood of the point. Corner detection is a topic in computer vision concerned with identifying corners and has its applications in object recognition, 3d image reconstruction, and so on. 

Harris corner detection aims to find windows in an image that generate large variation in edge gradient directions when moved around. We implement this corner detection algorithm and then compare the result with that of using the OpenCV library's algorithm. We also perform feature matching between two images of similar content but slight variations in image orientation.
